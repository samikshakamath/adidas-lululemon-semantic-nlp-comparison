## üß† NLP-Based Brand Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì Adidas vs. Lululemon

This project conducts a comparative analysis of consumer discourse surrounding Adidas and Lululemon by applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to unstructured Twitter data. Leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for unsupervised topic modeling and sentiment-aware text preprocessing, it uncovers latent thematic structures, emotional tone distributions, and brand-specific conversational patterns. The analysis reveals nuanced differences in customer perception, loyalty drivers, and experiential expectations, offering actionable insights for strategic marketing, brand positioning, and customer engagement optimization within the competitive apparel sector.
